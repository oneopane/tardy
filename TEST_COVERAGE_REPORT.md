## Testing Infrastructure Recommendations

### 1. Test Organization
- Create separate test files for each module (e.g., `task_test.zig`, `scheduler_test.zig`)
- Group related tests into test suites
- Implement test fixtures for common setup/teardown

### 2. Mock Infrastructure
- Develop mock implementations for system calls
- Create test harnesses for async operations
- Implement deterministic scheduling for reproducible tests

### 3. Coverage Metrics
- Integrate code coverage tools
- Set minimum coverage targets (suggested: 80% for critical paths)
- Track coverage trends over time

### 4. Continuous Testing
- Run tests on multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Test with different backend configurations
- Implement fuzzing for input validation

### 5. Documentation
- Document test scenarios and expected behaviors
- Create testing guidelines for contributors
- Maintain a test status dashboard

## Implementation Priority

1. **Immediate** (Week 1-2): Runtime core tests (task, scheduler, timer)
2. **Short-term** (Week 3-4): Async I/O backend tests
3. **Medium-term** (Month 2): Network and file system tests
4. **Long-term** (Month 3): Comprehensive integration and stress tests

## Estimated Coverage Impact

Implementing the recommended tests would increase coverage from approximately **15%** to **85%+**, providing confidence in:
- Runtime stability and correctness
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Performance characteristics
- Error handling robustness
- Concurrency safety
